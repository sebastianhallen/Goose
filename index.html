Goose
=====

Run arbitrary commands when saving a file that matches a specified glob.

v1.4.8 - beta
Support for solution reloads.

Note: From this relase there will be two versions of Goose - an experimental/beta/nightly/whenever-something-happens version and a more stable version.
The two versions will have different package ids so if you already have a version of Goose installed, uninstall it if you want to use the non-stable version. If you don't, you will have double installs and both will trigger your actions.
The stable version will be linked as soon as the unstable has been field tested.

Built in with debug configuration due to <a href="https://github.com/sebastianhallen/Goose/issues/14">#14</a>
